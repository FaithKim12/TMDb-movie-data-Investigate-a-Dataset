# TMDb-movie-data-Investigate-a-Dataset
This project involves analyzing the TMDb movie data set using Python. This dataset contains about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb) and it has about 10,000 rows and 21 columns. 
For this project, I used the Python libraries Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. I then went ahead to do some wrangling, cleaning, exploratory analysis then finally conclusions.
